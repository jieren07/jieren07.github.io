								<h1><a href="https://jieren07.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-adventure-of-x.html">Chapter I : I am X - The Source</a></h1>
									<p>It was a wonderful day. August 20, 2030. The wind blows very strong, it was raining outside and right now I am getting bored. I am X, well that’s what they call me. I am currently 20 years old. My hobby? Nothing, I’m just a nobody no athletic capabilities, very weak and lazy. My daily routine is just cleaning my room before eating my meal. Most of the time I am watching tutorials online. I’m a kind of fond with martial arts and other stuffs. Logical puzzles and everything. But it wasn’t suit me. Based from my capabilities.  You might say that I contradict myself being a lazy and yet I used to clean my room. It’s just that I can’t stand to see dust in my room. Come to think of it. I’ve forgotten to mention that I am all alone in my home. I have a lot of friends outside but most of the time I just want to stay at home. I can cook my own meal so I can say that I am independent. I go outside to buy stuffs relevant for my daily necessities.</p>

									<p>It was all started one night when I was asleep. A noise outside was so loud that it disturbed my sleep.</p>

									<p>What is that sound just now? I exclaimed!</p>

									<p>I got curious so I turned the lights on and I decided to look into it. I open the door and rush from the source of that noise. It was dark outside but suddenly a light took my attention. Beside the tree in my yard there was something moving. Suddenly that thing moved fast toward me. So fast that I couldn’t see until it got closed and knocked me out unconsciously. The next day I found myself in my bed when I wake up. Still a bit dizzy, flashes of memories engraved in my mind. Something has changed and I can feel it. I moved forward in front of my mirror. My physical feature changed, the weak and lazy me was gone. I couldn’t believe myself what I see now. All I can say is that it happened after that night.</p>

									<p>The next morning I wear my fav hoodie and decided to buy ingredients and stuffs outside. I stride but before I turn to an alley I heard a scream of a women being robbed. I also see someone in the window looking at the situation. The women was quite young, long hair and beautiful. The robber has a herculean figure. The robber didn’t notice me yet. I have a plan and thinking to attack the robber in a surprise then my body moved its own. I attacked the robber, first disarming the knife. Grabbed his wrist, smacked him on the ground and finish him with a single blow enough to knock him out. The women was saved, no casualty what so ever. She thanked me. I tied the robber with his own clothes and before I leave I asked the women if she could lend me some pen and paper. The police will arrive here soon we should leave a note for the police to spice things up. (I said it with a joke) the women laugh and lend me the pen and paper.</p>

									<p>In the note it says.</p>

									<p>Dear sir police officer, who ever you are. This is the robber who committed the robbery. Please do arrest him. There was a person who witnessed the event in that window if you look up in front of you. Have a nice day!</p>

									<p>X.</p>

									<p>When I got home. The incident was on the news. I never thought that it was being recorded. Is that me? Come to think of it. Since when did I have that agility? Then I recall the scenario from that night. Is it because of that?
									Voice: Did you like it? The power?</p>

									<p>X: Huh! Who’s there? Who are you? Show yourself!</p>

									<p>Voice: I’m you, you are me, to be exact we are one now. I’m the source. A power given to you. You are destined to have this power. When the time comes you will unlock your full potential. I am currently weak right now and needs a slumber. There are many people who has been granted by the source. You are one of the few. Different kinds of abilities and power spread across all around the world. One day you will face them.</p>

									<p>X: What do you mean the source? What power?</p>

									<p>Source: You’ve changed haven’t you? You can see the physical changes in your body. Its not that your body have changed. You will unlock it and will adapt eventually to the changes. When you’ve faced the robber earlier. It was your power that activates. You think and your body moved on its own. Well that is what you think. But actually it was the things recorded in your mind from the past. The martial arts that you’ve learn. You already have that. I the source help you to apply what you’ve already learnt. Since you have me and we are one now. That is how you did that.</p>

									<p>X: I see so that’s how it is.</p>

									<p>Source: As I’ve said it is just a chunk of your powers ability. But eventually you will adapt and learn new things from your power moving forward. Right now that’s all I have to say.</p>

									<p>With the source’s last words. It fades and gone. The voice vanished.</p>
									<br/>
									<h1><a href="https://jieren07.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-adventure-of-x-chapter-2.html">Chapter 2 : Growl the beast</a></h1>

									<p>The morning after the spread of the source. There was a guy who is angry all the time. The name is Growl. He’s like a wild animal and growling when he laughs. That is the origin of his name Growl. When he was a kid he was being beaten every time. Day and night non stop. It is because his father is a drunk man. His body adapted to this daily routine and got immune until he becomes numb and no senses with pain. In addition to that he grew strong with the power given to him by the source. When his father came home he irritates him and started beating him again and again. Growl started to laugh and that angers his father more. It is his coping mechanism, laughing while being beaten. He is hurt, inside but tolerant to physical pain. His father’s arm was bleeding, Growl doesn’t have any scratches, unlike in the past he is easily bruised and bleed. His father grabbed a knife and tried to stab Growl but the knife did nothing. It shattered like a glass, his skin was too tough. </p>

									<p>Growl: Are you done father?! (Saying it while laughing like a growling animal)</p>

									<p>His father surrender and leave with shock.</p>

									<p>His father screamed! A monster! Help!</p>

									<p>Growl laugh continuously, he punched a hole in their house’s wall. His father ran, the alcohol lost its effect in an instant. Growl destroyed the house and left.</p>

									<p>That day the news spread and his named made known.</p>

									<p>Out of rage, beaten and anger he destroyed anything that he wants to destroy. Robbing the bank and kill people mercilessly. Even the cops can’t do anything.</p>

									<p>He is a beast and Growl the beast was born.</p>
									<p>Some of the source’s host becomes an ordinary monster they are just rampaging because they have no ability to think and the source power is to much for them to handle. All they can do is destruction. They are the low level monsters produced by the source!</p>

									<p>Growl encountered several of them and was attacked, with only one swing of his knuckle he smashed one low level monster and the other ones are now intimidated.</p>

									<p>Growl wiped and beat every monster that he sees. Chasing them 1 by 1 until none of them exist in his sight. Once done he laugh.</p>

									<p>Growl: I love this feeling, the adrenaline rush. I want more! More! More!</p>

									<p>He was not satisfied from the fight. Growl walk away searching for satisfaction. While walking he bumped into a group of thugs.</p>

									<p>Thug: Hey what are you doing? Are you blind?</p>

									<p>Growl: Why?! Do you have a problem? (He laugh again like an insane person)</p>

									<p>Thug: Do you want to die huh?!</p>

									<p>Growl: Try me you moron!</p>

									<p>Thug: Surround him!</p>

									<p>Growl: 1, 2 ,3, …… 20? You are not enough!</p>

									<p>Thugs: Let’s see what you’ve got!</p>

									<p>One of them punched him on the face but the attacker broke his own arm. Half of thugs attacked him together. Some of them have knives. Growl did nothing, he was just standing and laughing. They are shocked because of his tough skin. Their knives can’t pierce into his skin. One of the thug drew a gun. You’re a dead men! Says the thug and shot him. The bullet bounces back, he is a bullet proof. Are you done? Growl shout at them. It’s my turn now!</p>

									<p>He crabbed one of the thugs head and threw it to the 5 who was about to escaped. The thugs are running and scattered. Growl is now hunting them. 1 by 1. They’ve reached different corners of the street. Screaming for help. People runs and the street are in chaos. One of the thugs left. It reached X’s yard.</p>

									<p>X is currently watering his plant then suddenly on the wall a person fell down. X’s reflexes is so fast the person almost hit him but he evades quickly.</p>

									<p>X: Hey! Are you ok sir?</p>

									<p>It was the boss of the thugs. Help me, hide me!. A monster chased us. He is not a human. A beast! My, my men. They are all dead! Hide me! Please!</p>

									<p>X: What do you mean a beast? Calm down and tell me everything.</p>

									<p>The boss of the thug is Steve, he told him everything. We can’t do anything we should hide! You should hide!</p>

									<p>X: Interesting eh? (Saying while smiling)</p>

									<p>Steve: What do you mean? He is so strong and tough! (The boss is scared and shaking)</p>

									<p>Suddenly a sound of heavy foot steps are getting closer and closer.</p>

									<p>Growl: Where are you rat? You can run but you can’t hide from me!</p>

									<p>X: Is that him? The Beast that you’re saying?</p>

									<p>Steve: Yes, please be quiet , hide me, I’m begging you.</p>
									<p>X: Let me face him.</p>
									<p>Steve: What? Are you deaf? I told you it’s a beast! No one can stop him!</p>

									<p>X: You leave I’ll be the bait. (Well I don’t want my house being destroyed after all though)</p>

									<p>X grabbed a stone and jumped over the wall of his yard. When he see Growl mid air he threw the rock at him and shout! Hey you! You’re so loud!</p>

									<h1><a href="https://jieren07.blogspot.com/2020/06/the-adventure-of-x-chapter-3.html">Chapter 3: X vs Growl</a></h1>

									<p>Growl was hit by the rock X thrown at him. He stare at X angrily and shout! Another rat to smash! Grrr! X run and told Growl to catch him if he can. Growl is now chasing X, he is searching for a good place to fight Growl. A place where no people might get caught in the fight. While chasing, Growl were swinging his fist in front of him. Due to his strength the wind was blowing heavily like a canon aiming X’s back. X dodges every attack from Growl.</p>

									<p>All the thing that’s get caught by his attack has been pulverized. What If I get caught with it? This scenario occur for several hours of running.</p>

								  <p>Finally the two of them reached an isolated wide area. Many trees around. Enough of running. Said X then he stopped facing Growl from behind him. I know you’re tired of running and I’ll fight you here now head on!</p>

									<p>Growl laugh once again, this time due to excitement. He dashed forward and tried to punch X but it was blocked, the impact throw him and the tree has been hit it fell down. Impossible said Growl, you should have broken your left wrist right now. X was standing, you have a strong arm huh. Your strength is formidable.</p>

									<p>Growl: You’re the first person to take my punch and can still stand. All the monsters that I hit with it are already dead now. All the things that I punch turned into pieces.</p>

									<p>X dashed toward Growl and kicked him several times. Growl can’t move because of his opponent’s agility. X never let Growl throw any punches instead he let him into defensive position. X strike with a spinning 45 kick with then a spinning round house kick alternately. To the body and the head then he gives a final blow of spinning axe kick. Growl blocked the final kick  from X. He grabbed his foot and throw him into the ground. X was down on the ground while Growl is attempting to throw his powerful punch to X.</p>

									<p>He wasn’t able to hit X once again, he stood up quickly and moved from Growls side then once behind X throw multiple punches all over Growl from foot to its head. (This isn’t enough yet).</p>

									<p>Growl throw punches and it got X ‘s stomach. The whole area was a mess but X is adapting as the match goes on. Growl picked a huge rock and threw it to X. It is so complicated says X. But I think I almost grasp my power. X just studying every situation and movement of his opponent. By experiencing the real battle his ability also increased. Now X blocked Growls attacked end it only caused him a little damaged. It seems like X mimicked his opponents ability. He moved now and attacked Growl, he kicked from below which make Growl fall. X grabbed Growl’s wrist and twisted it and by his knee he aim for the elbow. A loud crack has been heard. That attack is a best way to brake his opponents elbow. No matter how tough the skin or the opponents armor he knows that there is still a weak spot.</p>

									<p>In this fight the matched has been decided. You loose Growl. Only his left hand is functioning well. His broken arm is bleeding and he couldn’t move or use it to attack now. Growl doesn’t feel any pain no matter what the circumstances is. But right now he felt the pain.  He’s enjoying the fight then he tried to throw his left to punch X but he grabbed it.</p>

									<p>X: I can break your left arm too if I wanted too you know that right?</p>

									<p>Growl: It doesn’t matter as long as I can move I can fight!</p>

									<p>X: Why do you fight then? Tell me!</p>

									<p>Growl: I fight because I wanted to! My life is a mess so in return I wanted to mess things up. But this fight is different! You are the only suitable opponent to match and give this damage to me. I want to fight you! And that’s all I need! I want to!</p>

									<p>X: You are badly hurt now and couldn’t fight and yet you still wished to keep on fighting? I know that you aren’t really bad. Be my subordinate!</p>

									<p>Suddenly Growl tears fell!</p>

									<p>(I see so it seems like he just wanted to be recognized and accepted)</p>

									<p>X: That tears just now, don’t hide it. You know it’s ok to cry. It only proves that we are human!).</p>

									<p>Growl: I, I can’t help it! My father couldn’t accept me and always beats me up you know that! I’ve done many bad things before and yet you still wanted to be one of your subordinate?</p>

									<p>X: You know I have a lot of friends why not add another right? Fight me once again some other time. I’m a kind a bit tired.</p>

									<p>X suddenly pause for a moment.</p>

									<p>Growl: what are you doing?</p>

									<p>X: I’m activating my power, you know due to the match that we have I discovered something and I think it will work! You know I think my power is unique!</p>

									<p>X grabbed Growl’s broken arm and started healing it.</p>

									<p>Growl: why are you healing me I’m your opponent remember? I might attack you once again once I’m healed!</p>

									<p>X: I know that you won’t do that. You are my subordinate now and lets fight some other time.</p>

									<p>The moment he healed Growl he let him escaped!</p>
